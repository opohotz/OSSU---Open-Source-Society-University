>> I'm following the 'Core CS' track to solidify the knowledge that I learned from university.
>> The track takes approx. 2 years to complete given dedicated 20 hour workweeks to studies (2-3 hrs/day)
>> This course is taught in Racket through Dr.Racket and some HTML with the philosophy of choosing structure design over language popularity.
